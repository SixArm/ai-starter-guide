# Backpropagation

Backpropagation, short for "backward propagation of errors", is a fundamental algorithm used in training artificial neural networks, especially in the context of supervised learning. The main objective of backpropagation is to minimize the network's prediction error by adjusting the weights and biases associated with each neuron in the network. This adjustment is achieved by iteratively updating the parameters of the neural network based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters.

Stepsâ€¦

Forward Pass: Feed the input data into the neural network. The network processes the data through multiple layers of interconnected neurons, each layer applying weights and biases to the inputs and using activation functions to produce the output of each neuron.

Loss Calculation: Compare the output of the neural network to the actual target (ground truth) using a loss function, which quantifies how far the predictions are from the true values. Common loss functions include mean squared error (MSE) for regression problems and cross-entropy for classification problems.

Backward Pass: Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's weights and biases. This is achieved using the chain rule of calculus, which allows the gradients to be propagated backward through the layers of the neural network.

Gradient Descent: Update the parameters of the neural network (weights and biases) are updated in the opposite direction of the gradients, in a process known as gradient descent. The learning rate, a hyperparameter, determines the step size of the updates.

Iterative Process: Repeat over the entire training dataset multiple times (epochs) until the model converges to a point where the loss is minimized, and the neural network produces accurate predictions.
