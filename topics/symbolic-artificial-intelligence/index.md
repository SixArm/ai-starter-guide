# Symbolic Artificial Intelligence

Symbolic Artificial Intelligence, also known as Classical AI or Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI), is an approach to AI that focuses on the manipulation and processing of symbols and rules to simulate human cognitive processes.

In Symbolic AI, knowledge is typically represented using symbols, which can represent objects, concepts, or relationships between them. These symbols are manipulated using rules of logic and reasoning systems to derive new knowledge or solve problems.

Key featuresâ€¦

Knowledge Representation: Information is represented explicitly using symbols and rules, allowing for a structured and organized representation of knowledge.

Logic and Inference: Formal logic is used for reasoning and drawing conclusions based on the rules and relationships defined in the knowledge base.

Expert Systems: Symbolic AI gave rise to expert systems, which are rule-based systems that attempt to emulate the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains.

Symbolic Manipulation: The focus is on manipulating and processing symbols, rather than learning from data (as in machine learning approaches).

Symbolic AI has limitations. Constructing knowledge bases for complex domains can be time-consuming and require expert human knowledge. As the knowledge base grows, the computational complexity of inference and reasoning increases, leading to performance limitations. Additionally, symbolic representations may have difficulty dealing with vague or ambiguous information.
