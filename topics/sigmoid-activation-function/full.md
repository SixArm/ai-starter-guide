# Sigmoid activation function

The sigmoid activation function is a popular non-linear activation function used in artificial neural networks and other machine learning models. It is characterized by its S-shaped curve and maps the input values to a range between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks and problems where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability.

The sigmoid function is defined as follows:

f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

where:

* x is the input to the neuron.
* f(x) is the output of the neuron after applying the sigmoid activation function.

Key characteristics of the sigmoid activation function:

* Non-Linearity: The sigmoid function is non-linear, introducing non-linearity into the neural network. This non-linearity is essential for the network to learn and approximate complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.

* Output Range: The output of the sigmoid function always lies between 0 and 1. This makes it useful for binary classification tasks, where the output represents the probability of the positive class (class 1) in a binary decision.

* Vanishing Gradient Problem: One of the main drawbacks of the sigmoid activation function is the vanishing gradient problem. For very large positive or negative input values, the gradient of the sigmoid function approaches zero. This can lead to slow convergence and difficulty in training deep neural networks.

* Symmetry: The sigmoid function is symmetric around the origin (0, 0.5), meaning that it maps both positive and negative inputs close to 0.5.

While the sigmoid activation function was widely used in the past, it has become less popular for certain applications, especially in deep learning architectures. The vanishing gradient problem and the tendency of the sigmoid function to saturate for extreme inputs can hinder the training of deep neural networks, particularly in networks with many layers.

For hidden layers in deep neural networks, the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function and its variants (Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU, ELU) are commonly preferred over the sigmoid function. ReLU is computationally more efficient and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, leading to faster convergence during training.

However, the sigmoid activation function is still used in the output layer of binary classification models, where it produces a probability value between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood of belonging to the positive class. For multi-class classification tasks, the softmax activation function is often used in the output layer to obtain normalized class probabilities.
