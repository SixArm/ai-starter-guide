# Forward propagation

Forward propagation is the process in which input data is fed into a neural network, and the data is processed through the network's layers to produce an output or prediction. It is the first step in the operation of a neural network and is essential for making predictions during both training and inference phases.

The forward propagation process in a neural network can be summarized as follows:

* Input Data: The input data is provided to the neural network. For example, in a deep learning model for image classification, the input data could be an image represented as a matrix of pixel values.

* Input Layer: The input data is passed to the input layer of the neural network. Each neuron in the input layer represents a specific feature or attribute of the input data.

* Weights and Biases: Each connection between neurons in different layers has associated weights and biases. These weights represent the strength of the connection, and biases are additional values that adjust the output of a neuron.

* Weighted Sum: For each neuron in the hidden and output layers, the input data is multiplied by the corresponding weights, and the weighted sum of the inputs is computed. The weights determine the importance of each input feature.

* Activation Function: The weighted sum is then passed through an activation function, which introduces non-linearity to the output. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

* Output Layer: The output of the activation function becomes the input for the next layer, and this process is repeated through each layer of the neural network, including the hidden layers, until the output layer is reached.

* Final Prediction: The output layer produces the final prediction or output of the neural network. The number of neurons in the output layer corresponds to the number of classes in a classification task, and the neuron with the highest activation value often represents the predicted class.

The forward propagation process is used during both training and inference. During training, the network makes predictions on the training data, and the predictions are compared to the true labels to compute the loss or error. The gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters are then used in the backpropagation algorithm to update the weights and biases during training, optimizing the model's performance.

During inference, forward propagation is used to make predictions on new, unseen data after the neural network has been trained. The forward pass is computationally efficient and is executed rapidly in modern deep learning frameworks, allowing neural networks to make predictions in real-time applications.
