# Neural network (NN)

A neural network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of biological neural networks in the human brain. It is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns to perform tasks by adjusting its internal parameters based on the data it processes. Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in various artificial intelligence tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.

Key components and characteristics of a neural network include:

* Neurons (Nodes): The basic building blocks of a neural network are artificial neurons, also known as nodes or units. These neurons receive input, process it using a set of weights and biases, and produce an output.

* Connections (Edges): Neurons in a neural network are interconnected with weighted connections. The weights represent the strength of the connection between neurons and determine the influence of one neuron's output on another.

* Layers: Neurons in a neural network are organized into layers. The most common types of layers are:

  * a. Input Layer: The first layer that receives the raw input data. Each neuron in the input layer represents a feature or attribute of the input.

  * b. Hidden Layers: Layers between the input and output layers are known as hidden layers. These layers process the input data and extract relevant patterns and features.

  * c. Output Layer: The final layer of the neural network that produces the model's predictions or outputs.

* Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the output of neurons. They play a crucial role in enabling the neural network to model complex relationships in the data. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

* Forward Propagation: During the forward propagation phase, input data is fed into the neural network, and the data passes through the layers of interconnected neurons. Each neuron's output is computed based on the weighted sum of its inputs and the activation function.

* Training with Backpropagation: Neural networks are trained using an algorithm called backpropagation. During training, the network's parameters (weights and biases) are adjusted to minimize a loss function, representing the difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels in supervised learning tasks.

* Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple hidden layers are often referred to as deep neural networks, and the process of training such networks is known as deep learning. Deep learning has become a dominant paradigm in modern machine learning due to its ability to learn hierarchical representations from complex data.

Neural networks are known for their ability to learn from data and generalize to new, unseen examples. As they can automatically learn and represent complex patterns and relationships in the data, neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications, from computer vision and natural language processing to game playing and robotics. They continue to be a central focus of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
