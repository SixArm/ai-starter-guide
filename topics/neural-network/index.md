# Neural network (NN)

A neural network (NN) is a computational model inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain. It is a type of machine learning algorithm that learns to perform tasks by adjusting its internal parameters based on the data it processes. Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in various artificial intelligence tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing.

**Key aspects:**

Neurons (Nodes): The basic building blocks are artificial neurons, also known as nodes or units. These neurons receive input, process it using a set of weights and biases, then produce an output.

Connections (Edges): Neurons are interconnected via weighted connections. A weight represents the strength of the connection between two neurons.

Layers: Neurons in a neural network are organized into layers, such as one input layer, then hidden layers, then one output Layer.

Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the output of neurons. The functions enable modeling complex relationships in the data. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

Forward Propagation: During this phase, input data is fed into the network, and the data is processed via layers of interconnected neurons.

Training with Backpropagation: During this phase, the network's parameters (weights and biases) are adjusted to minimize a loss function, which represents the network's error.

Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple hidden layers are known as deep neural networks; the process of training such networks is known as deep learning.
