# Gradient descent

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum (or maximum) of a function, typically used in the context of training machine learning models. Its primary objective is to adjust the parameters of a model in the direction that reduces the value of a given loss function, allowing the model to better fit the training data and make more accurate predictions.

In the context of machine learning, the goal is to minimize the loss function, which measures the discrepancy between the model's predicted outputs and the true target values in a supervised learning task. The loss function quantifies how far off the predictions are from the ground truth.

Here's how the gradient descent algorithm works:

* Initialization: The algorithm starts with an initial guess for the model's parameters (weights and biases). These parameters represent the internal variables that the model uses to make predictions.

* Forward Pass: The input data is fed into the model, and the forward propagation process computes the model's predictions for the given inputs using the current values of the parameters.

* Loss Computation: The loss function is evaluated, measuring how well the model's predictions match the true target values.

* Backpropagation: The key step in gradient descent is to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to each model parameter. This is done using the chain rule of calculus, which allows the gradients to be propagated backward through the layers of the model.

* Gradient Update: With the gradients calculated, the algorithm updates the model's parameters by subtracting a small fraction (learning rate) of the gradients from their current values. The learning rate determines the step size of the update and affects the speed and stability of the optimization process.

* Iteration: Steps 2 to 5 are repeated iteratively, each time adjusting the parameters in the direction that reduces the loss. The algorithm continues until a stopping condition is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or when the change in loss becomes negligible.

By repeatedly updating the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, gradient descent moves toward the minimum of the loss function. If the loss function is convex (having a single minimum), gradient descent will converge to the global minimum. However, in practice, many loss functions are not strictly convex, and the algorithm may find a local minimum instead.

Variants of gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), mini-batch gradient descent, and adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., Adam), introduce additional optimizations and efficiencies to improve the convergence speed and stability of the algorithm during model training. Gradient descent forms the backbone of optimization in various machine learning models, enabling them to learn from data and make accurate predictions on unseen examples.
