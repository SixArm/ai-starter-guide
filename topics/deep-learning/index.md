# Deep learning

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence that focuses on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and represent complex patterns and hierarchical features from data. The term "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of deep neural networks, which consist of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons, allowing the model to learn progressively more abstract and intricate representations of the input data.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Neural Networks: Deep learning models are based on artificial neural networks, inspired by the the human brain. Each neuron in a neural network performs a simple computation. The neural network can transform data through multiple layers.

Feature Learning: Deep learning can automatically learn relevant features or representations from raw data. Instead of relying on hand-engineered features, deep learning models learn representations directly from the data during the training process.

Hierarchical Learning: Deep learning models learn hierarchical representations, where lower layers capture simple features, and higher layers capture more abstract and complex features. This hierarchical approach allows deep networks to model intricate patterns.

End-to-End Learning: Deep learning models are capable of end-to-end learning, where the model takes raw input data and directly produces the desired output, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.

Backpropagation: Deep learning models are typically trained using an optimization algorithm called backpropagation, which enables the model to adjust its settings to minimize the output error.

Scale: Deep learning models require substantial amounts of training data. The training process can be computationally intensive. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, deep learning relies on vast datasets and powerful hardware.
