# Vision Processing Unit (VPU)

A Vision Processing Unit (VPU) is a specialized hardware component or a dedicated processor designed to accelerate and handle tasks related to computer vision. These units are designed to perform complex vision tasks efficiently, often utilizing specialized architectures and hardware accelerators tailored for computer vision algorithms.

VPUs are specifically optimized for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, image classification, tracking, and other vision-related applications. They typically offload the processing workload from the main central processing unit (CPU) or graphics processing unit (GPU).

VPUs are commonly found inâ€¦

Smartphones and tablets: VPUs help power features like facial recognition, augmented reality (AR), and computational photography.

Security cameras: VPUs enable real-time object detection and tracking in surveillance systems.

Autonomous vehicles: VPUs play a crucial role in enabling self-driving cars to recognize and understand their surroundings.

Drones: VPUs are used in drones for tasks such as obstacle detection and navigation.

Robotics: VPUs help robots perceive their environment and interact with it effectively.
