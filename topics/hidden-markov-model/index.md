# Hidden Markov Model (HMM)

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model used to model systems with unobservable (hidden) states that produce a sequence of observable (visible) outputs. HMMs have found widespread application in various fields, including speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and many others.

An HMM consists of the following components:

* States: The system is assumed to be in one of several discrete states at any given time. The states are hidden because they are not directly observable.

* Observations: At each time step, the system emits an observable output (symbol) based on the underlying state. These observations are directly observable.

* State Transition Probabilities: HMMs model the transition between states using probabilities. The probability of transitioning from one state to another depends on the current state.

* Emission Probabilities: HMMs also model the probability of observing a particular output symbol (observation) given the current state.

The fundamental concept of an HMM is that the sequence of observable outputs is related to the sequence of hidden states. The model is trained on a dataset of observable sequences and uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm or the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate the model's parameters: state transition probabilities and emission probabilities.
