# Underfitting

Underfitting and overfitting are common issues that arise during the training of machine learning models. Both problems affect the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data, and they can have adverse effects on the model's performance and reliability.

Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. The model fails to fit the training data adequately and performs poorly on both the training data and new data.

Signs of underfitting:
* High training error (model performs poorly on training data).
* High test or validation error (model performs poorly on new data).
* The model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Causes of underfitting:
* Model too simple: Models with insufficient complexity may not have enough capacity to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
* Insufficient training: Insufficient or inadequate training of the model may lead to underfitting.

How to address underfitting:
* Use more complex models or increase the model's capacity.
* Improve the training process by adjusting hyperparameters or using different optimization techniques.
* Ensure that the training data is representative and contains enough information for the model to learn from.
