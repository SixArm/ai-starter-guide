# Chain of thought

The term "chain of thought" is often used to describe the sequence of reasoning steps or thought processes that an artificial intelligence system goes through to arrive at a decision or generate a response. It refers to the internal workings of the AI model as it processes input data and produces an output.

Key stagesâ€¦

Input Processing: The AI model receives input data, which could be text, images, or other forms of data, depending on the type of AI model. For language models, the input is typically a sequence of words.

Embedding: The input data is converted into a mathematical representation called an embedding. In natural language processing, for example, words or tokens are mapped to dense vectors in high-dimensional space.

Computation: The embedded data is processed through layers of artificial neurons in the model. Each layer performs computations, such as matrix multiplications, element-wise operations, and activation functions.

Attention Mechanisms (for certain models): In some AI models, like transformers, attention mechanisms help the model focus on especially-important parts of the input data when producing an output.

Sequence Processing (for language models): For language models, the chain of thought involves sequential processing of tokens, where the model generates one token at a time, based on the previous tokens.

Decoding: The model generates the output based on its internal computations, whether it's generating a response to a given question, completing a sentence, generating a translation, or any other task.

Post-Processing: Depending on the specific task, the output may undergo additional post-processing to ensure grammatical correctness, coherence, or other desired properties.
