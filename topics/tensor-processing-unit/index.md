# Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)

The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is a custom-designed application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to accelerate machine learning workloads, particularly those involving tensor operations. TPU is designed to be highly efficient in performing matrix multiplication and other tensor-related computations commonly used in neural networks and deep learning models.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Matrix Multiplication Acceleration: The TPU is optimized to perform large-scale matrix multiplication operations, which are fundamental to the training and inference phases of neural networks.

Parallelism: TPUs are designed with a large number of small processing cores, each capable of operating on different parts of the data simultaneously.

Tensor Cores: Tensor cores are specialized hardware units that accelerate the computations involved in deep learning tasks, particularly operations like matrix multiplications and convolutions.

Customized for TensorFlow: TPUs are natively integrated with Google's TensorFlow deep learning framework. This tight integration allows seamless usage of TPUs with TensorFlow-based models.

Cloud-based Acceleration: Google Cloud offers TPUs as a cloud service, enabling users to leverage the accelerated computation capabilities of TPUs without the need to invest in dedicated hardware.
