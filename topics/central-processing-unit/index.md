# Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is a critical component of a computer system. The CPU performs the majority of the processing operations necessary for the computer to function properly. In modern computing, CPUs are often accompanied by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and other specialized processing units to optimize performance for specific tasks.

**Key aspects:**

Execution: The CPU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them. Instructions are basic operations, such as arithmetic calculations, data moves, and logic comparisons.

Clock Speed: The CPU operates at a specific clock speed, which determines how many instructions it can execute per second.

Cores and Threads: Modern CPUs often have multiple processing cores, each capable of executing instructions independently. Some CPUs also support multiple threads per core.

Cache: CPUs have small but fast memory units called cache, which stores frequently accessed data and instructions. This cache helps reduce the time spent waiting for data from slower main memory (RAM).

Registers: CPUs have small, fast storage locations called registers, which hold data that the CPU is currently processing. Registers are essential for speeding up calculations and data movement.

Instruction Pipelining: CPUs often use instruction pipelining to overlap instruction execution stages, improving overall performance by processing multiple instructions simultaneously.
