# AI agent

An AI agent, also known as an artificial agent or intelligent agent, is a software program or system that can perform tasks or make decisions autonomously and proactively without direct human intervention. These agents are designed to operate in various environments, analyze data, learn from experience, and take actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents are a fundamental concept in the field of artificial intelligence and are used in a wide range of applications and domains.

Examples of AI agents include chatbots, AI assistants, autonomous vehicles, stock trading bots, and smart robots.

**Key aspects:**

* **Autonomy**: AI agents have a certain degree of autonomy, meaning they can operate independently and make decisions based on their internal programming, knowledge, and the information available to them.

* **Sensing**: Agents can perceive and gather information from their environment using sensors, which can include various data sources like cameras, microphones, and other sensors depending on the application.

* **Reasoning**: AI agents use reasoning mechanisms to process the information they have gathered and make informed decisions or predictions about the best course of action to achieve their goals.

* **Learning**: Many AI agents are equipped with machine learning capabilities, allowing them to learn from data and improve their performance over time.

* **Goal-Directed Behavior**: AI agents are designed to achieve specific objectives or goals, and their actions are directed towards optimizing their performance in pursuit of these objectives.
