# General Adversarial Network (GAN)

A General Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of machine learning model that consists of two neural networks, the generator, and the discriminator, engaged in a two-player adversarial game. The key idea is a generator network that creates synthetic data samples, such as images, music, or text, that are similar to the real data, while a discriminator network tries to distinguish between real data and synthetic data.

Here's how a GAN worksâ€¦

Generator: The generator network generates synthetic data samples. It maps inputs to the data space to create new data that should resemble the real data. Initially, the generator's outputs are random and do not resemble the real data.

Discriminator: The discriminator network acts as a binary classifier. It can input a real data sample or a synthetic data sample, then predicts whether the sample is real or synthetic. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated data effectively.

Adversarial Training: The GAN training process involves an adversarial game between the generator and the discriminator. The generator's goal is to create synthetic data that looks realistic. The discriminator's goal is to correctly categorize real data versus generated data.
During training, the generator and discriminator are updated alternately to improve their performance.

Convergence: As the training progresses, the generator improves its ability to generate realistic data, and the discriminator improves its ability to separate real data and synthetic data. In ideal conditions, the GAN converges to a point where the generator produces data that is so realistic that the discriminator cannot correctly classify it.
