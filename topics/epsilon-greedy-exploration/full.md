# Epsilon-greedy exploration

Epsilon-greedy exploration is a common strategy used in reinforcement learning to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation when an agent interacts with an environment. The agent faces the dilemma of choosing between exploiting the current best-known action (exploitation) and exploring other actions to discover potentially better ones (exploration). The epsilon-greedy strategy introduces randomness into the agent's action selection process, allowing it to explore while still favoring actions that seem to be optimal based on its current knowledge.

Here's how the epsilon-greedy exploration strategy works:

* Epsilon ($ϵ$): Epsilon is a hyperparameter that determines the probability of exploration. It ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates pure exploitation (always choosing the best-known action), and 1 indicates pure exploration (always choosing actions randomly).

* Action Selection:
* * With probability $1−ϵ$: Exploitation
* * * The agent selects the action with the highest estimated value ($Q$-value or policy probability) based on its current knowledge.
* * With probability $ϵ$: Exploration
* * * The agent selects a random action uniformly from the available action space.

The idea behind epsilon-greedy exploration is that initially, when the agent's knowledge is limited, exploration is crucial to discover the true values of different actions. As the agent gathers more experience and learns more about the environment, it gradually shifts its focus towards exploitation to maximize its rewards.

Choosing the appropriate value of $ϵ$ is important:

* A high $ϵ$ value encourages more exploration, which can be helpful in the early stages of learning or when there is substantial uncertainty about the optimal actions.

* A low $ϵ$ value emphasizes exploitation, which is advantageous when the agent has a good understanding of the environment and wants to exploit its current knowledge.

There are variations of epsilon-greedy exploration, such as using a decaying $ϵ$ schedule that decreases over time, reflecting the agent's learning progress. Additionally, techniques like softmax exploration can also be used to assign probabilities to actions based on their Q-values, providing a smoother exploration strategy.

Epsilon-greedy exploration is a simple yet effective strategy that strikes a balance between exploring new possibilities and exploiting the agent's current knowledge to maximize the cumulative rewards obtained during the learning process.
