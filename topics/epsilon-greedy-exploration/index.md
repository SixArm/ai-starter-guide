# Epsilon-greedy exploration

Epsilon-greedy exploration is a common strategy used in reinforcement learning to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation when an agent interacts with an environment.

The agent faces the dilemma of choosing between exploiting the current best-known action (exploitation) and exploring other actions to discover potentially better ones (exploration). The epsilon-greedy strategy introduces randomness into the agent's action selection process, allowing it to explore while still favoring actions that seem to be optimal based on its current knowledge.

* A high $ϵ$ value encourages more exploration, which can be helpful in the early stages of learning or when there is substantial uncertainty about the optimal actions.

* A low $ϵ$ value emphasizes exploitation, which is advantageous when the agent has a good understanding of the environment and wants to exploit its current knowledge.

There are variations of epsilon-greedy exploration, such as using a decaying $ϵ$ schedule that decreases over time, reflecting the agent's learning progress. Additionally, techniques like softmax exploration can also be used to assign probabilities to actions based on their Q-values, providing a smoother exploration strategy.
