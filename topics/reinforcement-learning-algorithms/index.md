# Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are a category of machine learning algorithms that enable an agent to learn how to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Reinforcement learning involves learning through trial and error, using a system of rewards and punishments.

Reinforcement learning is employed in a wide range of applications, including robotics, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems, and finance, where agents need to learn how to interact with dynamic environments and make sequential decisions to achieve long-term objectives.

Some common ones:

* Q-Learning: A model-free algorithm that uses a Q-value function to estimate the expected cumulative reward for taking a particular action in a given state.

* Deep Q Networks (DQN): An extension of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, enabling it to handle high-dimensional state spaces.

* Policy Gradient Methods: These algorithms directly optimize the policy to find the best actions, often using techniques like the REINFORCE algorithm or the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm.

* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG): An off-policy algorithm suitable for continuous action spaces, often used in robotic control tasks.

* Actor-Critic: A hybrid algorithm that combines elements of policy-based and value-based methods, using an actor to select actions and a critic to estimate the value of different actions.
