# Dimensionality reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while preserving the most important information. High-dimensional data can lead to challenges like increased computational complexity, overfitting, and difficulty in visualization. Dimensionality reduction methods aim to mitigate these issues by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation while maintaining its essential characteristics.

There are two main types of dimensionality reduction techniques:

* Feature Selection: In feature selection, you choose a subset of the original features to retain while discarding the rest. This can be done based on statistical tests, domain knowledge, or algorithms that rank features according to their relevance. Common methods include mutual information, correlation analysis, and recursive feature elimination.

* Feature Extraction: In feature extraction, new features are created from the original ones using linear or non-linear transformations. The goal is to represent the data in a more compact form that captures its most important patterns. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are examples of feature extraction techniques.

Two commonly used dimensionality reduction methods are:

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): By projecting the data onto a subset of these principal components, you can create a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much variance as possible.

* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): t-SNE maps high-dimensional data points into a lower-dimensional space (often 2D or 3D) in a way that maintains pairwise similarities between points.
