# Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a technique for computer graphics, particularly in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering. It is a data-driven approach that uses deep neural networks to model the volumetric representation of a scene's appearance and geometry.

Traditional methods for 3D scene reconstruction often rely on point clouds, meshes, or voxel grids, which can be memory-intensive and struggle to capture fine details and complex lighting effects.

NeRF, on the other hand, provides a continuous volumetric representation of the scene. The key idea of NeRF is to model a 3D scene as a continuous function, where the function takes a 3D point (position in space) as input, then outputs the radiance (color and opacity) of that point. By learning this function using deep neural networks, NeRF can model complex and realistic scenes.

Key stepsâ€¦

Data Collection: NeRF requires a set of images captured from different viewpoints of a scene. These images are often taken from a moving camera or multiple camera angles to capture various perspectives.

Training: A deep neural network, typically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), is trained to learn the volumetric function. During training, the network takes as input the 3D point (x, y, z) and the corresponding 2D image coordinates (u, v) from the input images. The network outputs the radiance (color and opacity) of that point, matching the pixel intensity in the corresponding image.

Volume Rendering: After training, the NeRF model is given a novel viewpoint or camera position, then predicts the radiance for each 3D point in the scene. By ray casting through the 3D space, the color and opacity of each pixel can be estimated, resulting in a photorealistic rendering of the scene from the new viewpoint.
