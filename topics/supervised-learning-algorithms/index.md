# Supervised learning algorithms

Supervised learning algorithms are a category of machine learning algorithms that learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

Various typesâ€¦

Linear regression: for predicting continuous numerical values. It learns a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. The output of the model is a continuous value.

Logistic regression: for binary classification problems, where the target variable has only two classes (e.g., true/false, yes/no). It predicts the probability of an input belonging to a particular class.

Decision Trees: for classification and regression tasks, to assign labels or continuous values based on the majority class or average value of data points within each region.

Random Forest: an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): for binary classification tasks. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the largest margin.

Neural Networks: for learning complex patterns from data. They have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various supervised learning tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): for classifying data points based on the majority class of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Gradient boosting: an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a strong learner with improved predictive performance.
