# Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized processor that is designed to perform complex mathematical calculations. Originally developed for rendering graphics in video games and 3D applications, GPUs have become essential in artificial intelligence, scientific simulations, and data processing.

Key aspectsâ€¦

Parallel Processing: GPUs are designed with hundreds to thousands of cores, which allow them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This parallel architecture is well-suited for tasks that involve heavy computations, as many operations can be processed concurrently.

Compute Power: Modern GPUs possess substantial compute power and are capable of performing general-purpose computing tasks (GPGPU or GPU computing). This capability has led to their use in data science, deep learning, cryptography, and other computationally demanding fields.

Programmability: CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and OpenCL (Open Computing Language) are programming frameworks that allow developers to write parallel code for GPUs. CUDA is specific to NVIDIA GPUs. OpenCL is more vendor-neutral and can be used with different GPU brands.

Tensor Cores: In more recent GPU architectures, specialized tensor cores have been introduced to accelerate operations frequently used in deep learning algorithms, such as matrix multiplications involved in neural network training.

GPU Memory: GPUs come with their own dedicated memory, which is crucial for storing intermediate data during computations. High memory bandwidth is essential for efficiently moving data between the CPU and GPU during processing.
