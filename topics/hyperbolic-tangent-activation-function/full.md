# Hyperbolic tangent activation function

The hyperbolic tangent activation function, often abbreviated as tanh, is a non-linear activation function widely used in artificial neural networks. It is similar to the sigmoid activation function but has a range between -1 and 1, making it a zero-centered function. The tanh function is mathematically defined as:

tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))

where:

* x is the input to the neuron.
* e is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828.

Key characteristics of the tanh activation function:

* Range: The tanh function maps the input to a range between -1 and 1. This means that negative inputs will be mapped close to -1, zero inputs to 0, and positive inputs to values close to 1.

* Zero-Centered: Unlike the sigmoid function, the tanh function is zero-centered, which means its output has a mean value of zero. This property can help in mitigating certain issues related to gradients during training, as it reduces the impact of vanishing gradients.

* Non-Linearity: The tanh function introduces non-linearity into the neural network, enabling it to learn and model complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

* Symmetry: The tanh function is symmetric around the origin (0, 0), meaning that it maps both positive and negative inputs close to 0.

The tanh activation function is often used in the hidden layers of neural networks, especially in architectures where ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or its variants might not be the best choice. It is particularly useful in cases where the input data has been standardized (centered around zero with unit variance) since the tanh function maintains zero-centered outputs.

However, similar to the sigmoid function, the tanh function can still suffer from the vanishing gradient problem for extremely large or small input values. In practice, the choice of activation function depends on the specific problem, the architecture of the neural network, and empirical performance on the validation data. Some researchers and practitioners prefer the ReLU and its variants as they tend to offer better training efficiency in deeper networks.
