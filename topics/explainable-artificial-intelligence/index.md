# Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to the development of AI systems and models that can provide understandable and transparent explanations for their decisions and actions. The goal of XAI is to make AI systems more interpretable to humans, enabling users to understand the underlying reasoning and logic behind the AI's outputs. This improves trust and adoption of AI systems where accountability and understanding are crucial.

**Key aspects:**

Interpretable Models: XAI models are more interpretable, such as rule-based systems, decision trees, or linear models. These have a clear decision-making process and can provide explanations at each step.

Post-hoc Explanations: For complex models, post-hoc explanation methods generate explanations after the model has made a prediction, highlighting the input features that had the most significant influence on the output.

Local and Global Explanations: Local explanations explain individual predictions, showing how specific inputs influenced the output. Global explanations offer insights into the overall behavior of the AI system across the entire dataset.

Visualizations: XAI often uses visualizations to present explanations in a more understandable and intuitive format, helping users to grasp the decision-making process easily.

Certainty and Confidence: XAI can also provide information about the certainty and confidence of its predictions, informing users about the reliability of the results.
