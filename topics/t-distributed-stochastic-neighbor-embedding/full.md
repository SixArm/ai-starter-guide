# t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique used for visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space. It is particularly effective at capturing and visualizing complex relationships and structures within the data. t-SNE was introduced by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton in 2008.

The primary purpose of t-SNE is to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the pairwise similarities between data points. Unlike some other dimensionality reduction techniques (such as PCA), t-SNE focuses on preserving local relationships and is well-suited for data visualization.

Here's how t-SNE works:

* Similarity Computation: For each data point in the high-dimensional space, t-SNE computes the pairwise similarity (usually using a Gaussian kernel) between that point and all other points. Similar data points in high-dimensional space will have higher similarities.

* Probability Distributions: t-SNE converts the similarities into conditional probabilities that measure the likelihood of choosing one data point as a neighbor given another data point as a reference. These probabilities are normalized for each data point.

* Lower-Dimensional Mapping: t-SNE constructs a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D) and assigns an initial random position to each data point in that space. It then aims to find a mapping that minimizes the divergence between the pairwise similarity distributions in the high-dimensional space and the lower-dimensional space.

* Gradient Descent: t-SNE uses gradient descent optimization to iteratively move the points in the lower-dimensional space so that the pairwise similarity distributions better match the high-dimensional similarity distributions. Points that have high similarities in the high-dimensional space are attracted to each other in the lower-dimensional space, and points with low similarities are repelled from each other.

One key characteristic of t-SNE is that it focuses more on preserving the local structure of the data, making it effective for revealing clusters, patterns, and relationships that might not be easily captured by linear methods like PCA. It is often used for exploratory data analysis, especially when trying to understand the relationships and groupings within high-dimensional data.

However, t-SNE has a few limitations:

* It's computationally expensive and can be slow for large datasets.
* It's not suited for reconstructing the original data or for making predictions.
* Different runs of t-SNE with the same data might yield different results due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm.

Overall, t-SNE is a valuable tool for data visualization and exploration, especially when dealing with complex high-dimensional datasets.
