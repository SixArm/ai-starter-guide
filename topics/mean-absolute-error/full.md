# Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a common performance metric used in regression tasks to evaluate the accuracy of a model's predictions. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual (ground truth) values. MAE is also known as the L1 loss or L1 norm.

The formula to calculate MAE is as follows:

MAE = (1/n) * Σ|yᵢ - ȳ|

where:

* n is the number of data points (samples) in the dataset.
* yᵢ represents the actual (ground truth) value of the target variable for the i-th data point.
* ȳ represents the predicted value of the target variable for the i-th data point.

MAE is a robust metric because it does not penalize outliers as much as Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares the differences between predicted and actual values. As a result, MAE is less sensitive to extreme values in the data.

Key characteristics of MAE:

* Interpretability: MAE is easy to interpret, as it represents the average absolute error in the target variable units. For example, if the target variable is measured in dollars, MAE will be in dollars as well.

* Robustness: MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE, making it a suitable choice for datasets with extreme values.

* Scale Independence: MAE is scale-independent, meaning it is not affected by the scale of the target variable. This makes it easier to compare models trained on different datasets or with different units of measurement.

However, one potential drawback of MAE is that it treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. In some cases, a large error may be more critical than a smaller one, and other metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) may be more appropriate.

Overall, MAE provides a straightforward and interpretable way to assess the model's average prediction error. The choice of using MAE or other regression metrics depends on the specific context and the desired characteristics of the evaluation metric for the particular regression problem at hand.
