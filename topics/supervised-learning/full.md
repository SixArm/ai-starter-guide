# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is associated with its corresponding output or target value. The objective of supervised learning is to learn a mapping or relationship between the input data and the output labels, allowing the algorithm to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In supervised learning, the process can be summarized as follows:

* Input Data: The training dataset consists of input data examples, also known as features or attributes. These could be images, text, numerical values, or any other form of data.

* Output Labels: Each input data example is paired with its corresponding output label or target value. The labels represent the desired output or the correct answer for the given input.

* Model Training: The supervised learning algorithm uses the labeled training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels. It iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the discrepancy between its predicted outputs and the true labels.

* Model Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Given a set of input features, the model uses the learned mapping to generate the corresponding output labels or predictions.

Supervised learning can be further categorized into two main types based on the nature of the output labels:

* Classification: In classification tasks, the output labels belong to a finite set of predefined classes or categories. The goal is to classify input data into one of these classes. Common examples include image classification (identifying objects in images), spam detection (labeling emails as spam or not spam), and sentiment analysis (determining the sentiment of a text as positive or negative).

* Regression: In regression tasks, the output labels are continuous numerical values. The objective is to predict a numerical value based on the input data. Examples of regression tasks include predicting housing prices based on features like area, number of rooms, etc., or forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

Supervised learning is one of the most commonly used and well-established approaches in machine learning. It has a wide range of applications in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, finance, recommendation systems, and more. The success of supervised learning relies heavily on having a high-quality labeled training dataset, as the performance of the model is heavily influenced by the quality and representativeness of the training examples.
