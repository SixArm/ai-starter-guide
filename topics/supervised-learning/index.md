# Supervised learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input data point is associated with its corresponding output or target value. The objective of supervised learning is to learn a mapping or relationship between the input data and the output labels, allowing the algorithm to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Key aspects:**

Input Data: The training dataset consists of input data examples, also known as features or attributes. These could be images, text, numerical values, or any other form of data.

Output Labels: Each input data example is paired with its corresponding output label or target value. The labels represent the desired output or the correct answer for the given input.

Model Training: The supervised learning algorithm uses the labeled training data to learn the relationship between the input features and the output labels.

Model Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Given a set of input features, the model uses the learned mapping to predict the corresponding output labels.

Supervised learning can be further categorized into two main types based on the nature of the output labels: classification (which uses output labels that are finite set of predefined classes) and regression (which uses output labels that are continuous numerical values).
