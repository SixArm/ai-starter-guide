# Machine learning hyperparameters

Machine learning hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and control various aspects of the training procedure. These parameters are not learned from the data like the model's weights but are rather set by the user or determined through a search process. The proper tuning of hyperparameters is essential for achieving the best performance of a machine learning model.

Here are some common hyperparameters found in machine learning algorithms:

* Learning Rate: This hyperparameter determines the step size taken during gradient descent optimization. A high learning rate can lead to overshooting, while a low one can slow down convergence.

* Batch Size: It defines the number of training examples used in each iteration of the gradient descent optimization. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster convergence, but they also require more memory.

* Number of Epochs: An epoch represents a full pass through the training data. The number of epochs determines how many times the algorithm iterates through the entire dataset.

* Number of Hidden Units/Layers: In neural networks, the number of hidden units and layers can significantly affect the model's capacity and ability to learn complex patterns.

* Activation Functions: Activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh impact how signals are transformed within a neural network's layers.

* Regularization Parameters: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization control the amount of regularization applied to the model's weights to prevent overfitting.

* Dropout Rate: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops a fraction of units during each training step, which helps prevent overfitting.

* Kernel Parameters: In algorithms like Support Vector Machines, kernel parameters determine the shape of the decision boundary.

* Number of Neighbors: In algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors, the number of neighbors used for prediction can influence the model's performance.

* C and Gamma (SVM): These parameters control the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error in Support Vector Machines.

* Tree Depth and Number of Trees (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting): These hyperparameters affect the structure and complexity of decision trees.

* Dropout Rate (Recurrent Neural Networks): In RNNs, dropout can be applied between recurrent layers to avoid overfitting.

Selecting appropriate hyperparameters often involves a combination of domain knowledge, experimentation, and automated techniques like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Careful tuning of hyperparameters can significantly impact a model's performance and generalization to new data.
