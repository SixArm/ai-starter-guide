# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of deep learning model primarily used for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images and videos. The key advantage of CNNs is their ability to learn hierarchical and spatially invariant representations from visual data. Convolutional layers capture local patterns, while pooling layers summarize the learned features across larger regions, enabling the network to recognize complex patterns and objects in different positions and orientations within the input images. CNNs are especially good for image classification, image segmentation, object detection,

Key aspectsâ€¦

Convolutional Layers: These layers consist of small filters or kernels that slide (convolve) over the input image to perform element-wise multiplication and summation, producing feature maps. The filters learn to detect different patterns and features in the input data.

Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers. Pooling helps reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and extract the most relevant information.

Activation Functions: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the CNN, allowing it to model complex relationships. Common activation functions include ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, and tanh.

Fully Connected Layers: After several convolutional and pooling layers, the output is typically flattened and passed through fully connected layers. These layers are similar to those in traditional neural networks, and make final predictions based on the extracted features.

Training with Backpropagation: CNNs are trained using backpropagation and gradient descent, where the network's parameters (weights and biases) are updated to minimize a loss function, representing the difference between the predicted labels and the true labels in supervised learning tasks.
