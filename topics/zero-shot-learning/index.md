# Zero-shot learning

Zero-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is capable of making predictions for classes that it has never seen or been directly trained on. Unlike traditional supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data for a specific set of classes, zero-shot learning enables the model to generalize to new classes not present in the training data.

There are several variants of zero-shot learning, including attribute-based zero-shot learning, text-based zero-shot learning, and semantic embeddings.

The processâ€¦

Training Data: Provide the model with examples from a set of seen or known classes. Each example is associated with its corresponding class label.

Semantic Information: Provide the model with auxiliary semantic information about both the seen and unseen classes. This information could be in the form of attributes, textual descriptions, etc.

Knowledge Transfer: During training, the model learns to associate the seen classes and the semantic information.

Prediction on Unseen Classes: After training, the model can make predictions on examples from unseen or novel classes using the learned associations between visual features and semantic information.

Zero-shot learning is particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining labeled data for all possible classes is challenging, time-consuming, or costly. It allows the model to adapt to new classes without the need for retraining, making it more flexible and scalable in real-world applications.
