# Validation data

Validation data, also known as the validation set, is a separate subset of data used to assess the performance of a machine learning model during the training process. It serves as an intermediate step between the training data and the test data, helping to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

The process of training a machine learning model involves adjusting its parameters based on the patterns and relationships found in the training data. However, using the same data to both train and evaluate the model can lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs very well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.

To prevent overfitting and get a more realistic estimate of the model's performance, a portion of the available data is set aside as the validation set. During the training process, the model is evaluated on the validation set after each training iteration or epoch. This evaluation helps monitor the model's performance on data that it has not seen during training.

The validation set is crucial for hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and assessing the effectiveness of the chosen model architecture. By comparing the model's performance on the training data and the validation data, it is possible to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
