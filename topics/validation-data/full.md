# Validation data

Validation data, also known as the validation set, is a separate subset of data used to assess the performance of a machine learning model during the training process. It serves as an intermediate step between the training data and the test data, helping to evaluate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

The process of training a machine learning model involves adjusting its parameters based on the patterns and relationships found in the training data. However, using the same data to both train and evaluate the model can lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs very well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.

To prevent overfitting and get a more realistic estimate of the model's performance, a portion of the available data is set aside as the validation set. During the training process, the model is evaluated on the validation set after each training iteration or epoch. This evaluation helps monitor the model's performance on data that it has not seen during training.

The validation set is crucial for hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and assessing the effectiveness of the chosen model architecture. By comparing the model's performance on the training data and the validation data, it is possible to fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

The typical data split used in machine learning is as follows:

* Training Data: The largest portion of the data (usually around 70-80% of the total dataset) used to train the model and adjust its parameters.

* Validation Data: A smaller subset of the data (around 10-20%) used to evaluate the model's performance during training and make decisions about hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

* Test Data: The remaining portion of the data (around 10-20%) used as an independent set to assess the final performance of the trained model. This data should not be used during model development or hyperparameter tuning to avoid data leakage.

The validation data serves as a critical tool in the machine learning workflow, helping to ensure that the trained model generalizes well to unseen data and performs effectively in real-world scenarios.
