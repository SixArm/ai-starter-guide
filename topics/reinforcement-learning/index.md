# Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning and artificial intelligence that focuses on how an agent can learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It is inspired by behavioral psychology, where learning is achieved through trial-and-error and feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. It is well-suited for problems where the optimal strategy is not known beforehand.

Key aspects…

Agent: The learner that interacts with the environment.

Environment: The external system that contains the agent.

State (s): A representation of the current situation in the environment.

Action (a): The set of moves that the agent can take in a given state.

Reward (r): A scalar value that the environment provides to the agent, after the agent does a specific action in a specific state.

Policy (π): A strategy followed by the agent, which maps states to actions. It defines the agent's behavior.

The RL process can be summarized in the following steps…

Exploration and Exploitation: The agent explores the environment by taking different actions to discover potential rewards.

Interaction: The agent takes actions based on its current policy, which leads to state transitions.

Reward Collection: The agent receives rewards from the environment as feedback, providing information about the desirability of its actions.

Learning: The agent updates its policy based on the rewards.

Goal: The objective of the agent is to find the policy that maximizes the cumulative rewards over time, ultimately achieving its desired goals.
