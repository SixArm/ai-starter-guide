# Unsupervised learning algorithms

Unsupervised learning algorithms are a category of machine learning algorithms that aim to discover patterns, structures, or representations in the data without any explicit guidance such as target labels or correct outputs.

Clustering Algorithms:

* K-means Clustering: Partition data points into k clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids.
* Hierarchical Clustering: Organize data into a tree-like structure of nested clusters.

Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms:

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce while preserving most of the information.
* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE): Reduce by emphasizing the local structure and preserving pairwise similarities.

Anomaly Detection Algorithms:

* Isolation Forest: Identify outliers by isolating them in a random forest-like structure.
* Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Measure the local deviation of data points to identify outliers.

Generative Models:

* Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Model a combination of distributions, allowing data generation and density estimation.
* Variational Autoencoders (VAE): Learn to generate new data samples by mapping them to a latent space.

Self-Organizing Maps (SOM): Project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional grid, preserving the data's topological structure.
