# Test data

Test data, also known as the test set, is a separate subset of data used to evaluate the performance of a trained machine learning model. It serves as an independent measure of how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data and assess its ability to make accurate predictions on data it has not encountered during training.

Test data is crucial for providing an unbiased estimate of the model's performance and to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new data, indicating that the model has memorized patterns in the training set rather than learning meaningful patterns.

Typical stepsâ€¦

Model Training: The model is trained using the training data, which includes input samples and their corresponding target labels.

Hyperparameter Tuning: If hyperparameters need tuning, a separate validation set may be used to fine-tune them and select the best-performing model configuration.

Model Evaluation: After training and hyperparameter tuning, the model's performance is assessed using the test set. The model processes the test set samples and makes predictions, and the predictions are compared to the true target labels.

Performance Metrics: Various performance metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance, depending on the type of problem. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).
