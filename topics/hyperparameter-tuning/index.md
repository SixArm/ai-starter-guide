# Hyperparameter tuning

Hyperparameter tuning, also known as hyperparameter optimization, is the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and cannot be learned from the data directly. Common examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, number of hidden layers in a neural network, number of trees in a random forest, regularization strength, batch size, and so on. Automated hyperparameter tuning libraries and tools are available in popular machine learning frameworks e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

**General steps:**

Define a Search Space: Define a range or set of possible values for each hyperparameter that you want to tune. An optimization algorithm will search this space for the best hyperparameters.

Choose an Optimization Strategy: There are strategies to explore the hyperparameter search space, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, genetic algorithms, and more.

Evaluation: For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained on a subset of the training data (usually called the validation set). A predefined evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error) is used to measure how well the model performs.

Select the Best Hyperparameters: After evaluating all combinations, the hyperparameters that yield the best performance on the validation set are selected as the optimal hyperparameters.

Test Set Performance: Finally, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set (not used during hyperparameter tuning) to assess its generalization performance.
