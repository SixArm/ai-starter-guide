# Computer processors

Computer processors are essential components that perform different types of computations and tasks in a computer system.

Some common types of processorsâ€¦

Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is a general-purpose processor responsible for executing instructions and handling most of the computations in a computer. It performs tasks such as running applications, managing the operating system, and handling input/output operations.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): The GPU is a specialized processor for graphical computations, rendering images, videos, and 3D graphics, making it well-suited for gaming, video editing, computer-aided design (CAD), and other graphics-intensive applications. In addition to graphics, GPUs can also be used for general-purpose parallel computations, a concept known as General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing.

Tensor Processing Unit (TPU): The TPU is a specialized processor developed by Google for accelerating machine learning tasks, particularly those involving neural networks. TPUs are optimized for matrix operations and are well-suited for tasks like training and inference in deep learning models. They are designed to provide high-performance and energy-efficient solutions for machine learning workloads.

Vision Processing Unit (VPU): As mentioned earlier, the VPU is a specialized processor focused on computer vision tasks. It is optimized for handling tasks like object detection, image recognition, and video analysis. VPUs are commonly found in devices and systems that require real-time processing of visual information, such as smartphones, security cameras, and autonomous vehicles.
