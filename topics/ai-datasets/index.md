# AI datasets

AI datasets are large collections of data that are used to train, validate, and test artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. These datasets are essential for teaching AI algorithms to recognize patterns, make predictions, and perform various tasks accurately.

**Common types**:

* **Image Datasets**: Images labeled with categories. Good for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. Examples: ImageNet, COCO (Common Objects in Context), and CIFAR-10.

* **Text Datasets**: Written information, such as documents and articles. Good for natural language processing (NLP). Examples: Stanford Sentiment Treebank, IMDb movie reviews, and Gutenberg Books.

* **Sound Datasets**: Audio and speech recordings. Good for audio classification and speech recognition. Examples for audio: UrbanSound and ESC-50. Examples for speech: LibriSpeech and CommonVoice.

* **Video Datasets**: Video clips. Good for action recognition, video captioning, and video object tracking. Examples: the Kinetics dataset and the Sports-1M dataset.

* **Reinforcement Learning Datasets**: Good for training reinforcement learning algorithms, where an agent learns via an environment. Examples: OpenAI Gym and Atari 2600 Games.

* **Time Series Datasets**: Sequential data points recorded over time. Good for stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and anomaly detection. Examples: Air Quality dataset and EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset.

* **Multi-modal Datasets**: These datasets combine data from different modalities, such as text, images, and audio. They are used for tasks that require the model to process and understand information from multiple sources. Examples: Multi30K dataset and the VQA (Visual Question Answering) dataset.
