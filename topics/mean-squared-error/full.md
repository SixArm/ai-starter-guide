# Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a commonly used performance metric for regression problems in machine learning. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual (ground truth) values. MSE is particularly useful for evaluating how well a regression model's predictions match the true values and how much error is present in the predictions.

The formula for computing the Mean Squared Error is as follows:

* MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ȳᵢ)²

Where:

* n is the number of data points (samples) in the dataset.
* yᵢ represents the actual (ground truth) value of the target variable for the i-th data point.
* ȳᵢ is the predicted value of the target variable for the i-th data point.

The steps to calculate MSE are as follows:

* Make predictions using the regression model on the test set or validation set.

* For each data point in the test set, compute the squared difference between the predicted value and the actual value.

* Sum up all the squared differences.

* Divide the sum by the number of data points to get the average squared difference, which is the Mean Squared Error.

Interpretation of MSE:

* Lower MSE: A lower MSE value indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the true values, suggesting better overall performance.

* Higher MSE: A higher MSE value indicates that the model's predictions are farther away from the true values, suggesting poorer performance.

MSE is widely used in regression tasks due to its mathematical properties. One drawback of MSE is that it gives higher weight to large errors due to the squared term, which may be undesirable in some cases. In such situations, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) can be used as an alternative, as it measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, without squaring the errors.

Both MSE and MAE are part of a family of performance metrics known as loss functions, which quantify the model's error during training and guide the optimization process to find the best model parameters for the given regression problem.
