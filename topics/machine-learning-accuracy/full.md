# Machine learning accuracy

Accuracy is a machine learning performance metric, particularly useful in classification tasks.

Accuracy is a measure of how often the model's predictions are correct, given the total number of predictions. It represents the proportion of correctly classified samples (both true positives and true negatives) over the total number of samples in the dataset.

Formula: Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)

High accuracy indicates that the model is making correct predictions most of the time. However, accuracy can be misleading, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class dominates the other. In such cases, a high accuracy score might not necessarily mean that the model is performing well, as it may be mostly due to the model's ability to correctly predict the dominant class.

    Precision:
    Precision is a measure of how many of the predicted positive instances are actually positive. It represents the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive class) over the total positive predictions (both true positives and false positives). Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and is particularly useful when the cost of false positives is high.

    The formula to calculate precision is as follows:

    Precision = (True Positives) / (True Positives + False Positives)

    A high precision score indicates that when the model predicts a positive instance, it is likely to be correct. However, a high precision may come at the cost of increased false negatives, as the model may be more conservative in making positive predictions.

To illustrate the difference between accuracy and precision, consider a binary classification task for detecting a rare disease, where the positive class represents individuals with the disease, and the negative class represents individuals without the disease.

    A model with high accuracy means that it correctly classifies most individuals (both with and without the disease), but it might still misclassify some individuals with the disease (false negatives) and individuals without the disease (false positives).

    A model with high precision means that when it predicts an individual has the disease, it is likely to be correct. However, it may have a higher number of false negatives (individuals with the disease classified as negative) to achieve this high precision.

In summary, accuracy provides an overall measure of the model's performance, while precision focuses on the correctness of positive predictions. The choice of which metric to prioritize depends on the specific problem and the consequences of false positives and false negatives in the application.
