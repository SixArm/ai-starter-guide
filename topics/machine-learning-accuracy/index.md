# Machine learning accuracy

Accuracy is a machine learning performance metric. It is particularly used in classification tasks.

Accuracy is a measure of how often the model's predictions are correct, given the total number of predictions. It represents the proportion of correctly classified samples (both true positives and true negatives) over the total number of samples in the dataset.

Formula:

  * $Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Number of Predictions)$

High accuracy indicates that the model is making correct predictions most of the time. However, accuracy can be misleading, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class dominates the other. In such cases, a high accuracy score might not necessarily mean that the model is performing well, as it may be mostly due to the model's ability to correctly predict the dominant class.
