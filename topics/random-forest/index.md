# Random forest

Random forest is an ensemble learning technique that leverages the strength of multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate predictive model. It's widely used for both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest builds a "forest" of decision trees and combines their predictions to improve overall accuracy and generalization. 

Random Forest can be a go-to choice for a wide range of machine learning problems. Its robustness, simplicity, and capability to handle both categorical and numerical data make it a popular choice among data scientists and practitioners.

Key features and advantages of random forest include robustness, feature importance estimation, parallelization ability, and few hyperparameters. Limitations include challenging interpretability, high memory and compute, and tradeoff between bias and variance.

Stepsâ€¦

Bootstrapped Sampling: The algorithm creates multiple random subsets (bootstrapped samples) from the original training dataset. Each subset has the same number of data points as the original dataset but may contain duplicate instances.

Decision Tree Construction: For each bootstrapped sample, a decision tree is constructed. However, during the construction process, at each node, a random subset of features is considered for splitting, rather than using all the features. This introduces randomness and diversity among the trees.

Voting or Averaging: For classification tasks, each tree in the forest "votes" for a class, and the class with the most votes becomes the final prediction. For regression tasks, the predictions from all trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction.
