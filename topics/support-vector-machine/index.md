# Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is well-suited for problems with complex decision boundaries. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in the feature space.

The key idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane (a decision boundary in two-dimensional space) that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. The data points closest to the hyperplane are known as support vectors, which are instrumental in defining the hyperplane and the margin.

SVM can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets. For non-linearly separable datasets, SVM employs the kernel trick to map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it becomes linearly separable. Commonly used kernel functions include the polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel.

Advantages:

* Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
* Good generalization to new, unseen data.
* Suitable for both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
* Robust against overfitting, especially with proper regularization.

Disadvantages:

* Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
* Tuning hyperparameters can be challenging.
* Interpreting the the importance of features can be difficult.
