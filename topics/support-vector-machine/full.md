# Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and is well-suited for problems with complex decision boundaries. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in the feature space.

The key idea behind SVM is to find a hyperplane (a decision boundary in two-dimensional space) that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. The data points closest to the hyperplane are known as support vectors, which are instrumental in defining the hyperplane and the margin.

For classification tasks, SVM aims to find the hyperplane that separates the positive and negative examples with the widest possible margin. This is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane or the optimal separating hyperplane.

Hyperplane formula: w · x + b = 0

* w is the weight vector perpendicular to the hyperplane.
*
* x is the input feature vector.

* b is the bias term (intercept).

The classification decision is made based on the sign of w · x + b. If w · x + b > 0, the sample is classified as the positive class; otherwise, it is classified as the negative class.

SVM can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets. For non-linearly separable datasets, SVM employs the kernel trick to map the data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it becomes linearly separable. Commonly used kernel functions include the polynomial kernel, radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and sigmoid kernel.

Advantages of SVM:

* Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
* Good generalization to new, unseen data.
* Suitable for both linear and non-linear classification tasks.
* Robust against overfitting, especially with proper regularization.

Disadvantages of SVM:

* Computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.
* Tuning hyperparameters, such as the choice of kernel and regularization parameters, can be challenging.
* Interpreting the model and understanding the importance of features can be difficult.

SVM has found applications in various fields, including image recognition, text classification, bioinformatics, and finance. It remains a popular choice for many classification tasks due to its versatility and effectiveness in handling different types of data.
