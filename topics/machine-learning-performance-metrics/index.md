# Machine learning performance metrics

Machine learning performance metrics are quantitative measures used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. These metrics help assess how well the model is making predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. The choice of performance metrics depends on the type of machine learning task, such as classification, regression, or clustering.

Some common performance metricsâ€¦

Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, F1-Score, recall (a.k.a. true positive rate), specificity (a.k.a. true negative rate), receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the curve (AUC).

Regression metrics: mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2).

Clustering metrics: silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and adjusted rand index (ARI).

These are just a few examples of machine learning performance metrics. The choice of appropriate metrics depends on the specific problem and the objectives of the machine learning task. It's important to consider multiple metrics to get a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.
