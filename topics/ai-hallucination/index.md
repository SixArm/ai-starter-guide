# AI hallucination

In the context of artificial intelligence, "hallucination" refers to a phenomenon where a model generates content that is not based on actual data or is significantly different from reality. It is an issue that can arise in certain AI models, particularly generative models, where the model produces outputs that do not align with the underlying data distribution or training examples.

**AI models**:

* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: GANs can sometimes suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a limited variety of outputs, failing to capture the full diversity of the training data. This can lead to the generator "hallucinating" unrealistic samples that were not present in the original data distribution.

* **Language Models**: Language models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers, might generate text that appears plausible but lacks factual accuracy or coherence. They can produce sentences that sound fluent but are entirely fictional or nonsensical.

* **Image Generators**: Image generation models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or deep neural networks, can produce images that resemble real objects but contain unrealistic details or combinations of features that don't exist in reality.

* **Text-to-Image Generation**: Models that attempt to generate images from textual descriptions may sometimes produce images that do not accurately match the given descriptions, leading to a form of hallucination.

Hallucination is considered an undesirable behavior in AI models, as it reduces the reliability and trustworthiness of their outputs. To mitigate hallucination, researchers and developers employ various techniques such as data augmentation, regularization to prevent overfitting, adversarial training, and human-in-the-loop validation.
