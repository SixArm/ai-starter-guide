# Deep Q Networks (DQNs)

Deep Q Networks (DQNs) are a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning, a popular technique for solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), with deep neural networks. DQNs are used to handle high-dimensional state spaces, making them particularly suitable for complex tasks in which traditional tabular Q-Learning would be impractical.

Advantages of deep q networks include handling complex state spaces and end-to-end learning. Challenges include training instability, crucial hyperparameter tuning, and exploration-exploitation tradeoff tuning.

Various extensions and improvements have been proposed, including Double Q-learning, Dueling DQNs, and Rainbow DQN, which combine multiple enhancements to improve performance and training stability. 

Key aspectsâ€¦

Neural Network Architecture: A deep neural network is used to approximate the Q-function. The network takes the current state as input and outputs Q-values for all possible actions.

Experience Replay: DQNs use an experience replay buffer to store experiences (state, action, reward, next state) encountered during interactions with the environment. 

Two Networks: DQNs use an "online" network (policy network) and a "target" network. The target network's parameters are updated less frequently, which helps stabilization.

Bellman Equation: The network is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted Q-values and the "target" Q-values, which are computed using the Bellman equation.

Epsilon-Greedy Exploration: To balance exploration and exploitation, DQNs often use an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
